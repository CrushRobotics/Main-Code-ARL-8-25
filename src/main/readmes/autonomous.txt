Here is what we think we might be able to do to make autonomous work.

Use the PathPlanner library and the AutoBuilder.configureRamsete method.

Pass it a drive method that is passed a ChassisSpeeds.

Convert ChassissSpeeds to wheelspeeds using DifferentialDriveKinematics.

Feed wheel speeds into Spark Max PID Controllers.

----------------------


Before we can use the PID controllers we'll need to characterize the robot's drive train.
